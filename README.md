# IMDB data Statistical analysis
Viewers rate movies based on how they perceive its content. This may seem like a simple concept and
one that we are all familiar with, however, we were intrigued to find out if this simplicity is merely on the
surface or if movie characteristics influence the thumbs up or thumbs down and the number from 1-10
that we see when clicking into a movie title. Scott Wallsten of Technology Poly Institute analyzed IMDb
ratings for a set of about 4,000 movies and concluded that “an additional point on IMDB (on a scale of 1
to 10) is associated with an additional $38 million in worldwide revenues.” What affects this impactful
number?

Zeroing in on the relationships between genre of movie and rating of movie, our research question is as
follows: Do the genres of comedy and horror affect movie ratings? These two genres were chosen for
comparison, as we found that these genres did not overlap for movies in our dataset. Analyzing genres
with such polarizing characteristics would lead to more definitive comparison results than other genres. If
there are factors affecting movie ratings, audiences and production companies alike should be aware of
these instances.
